# PSocket
TCP Socket plugin for San Andreas Multiplayer. Enables custom gamemodes to communicate with other services via raw TCP sockets.

Originally, this socket was the core of my ScriptPlayer plugin I created in 2009 (or somewhere around there) with the help of JeNkStA from IV:MP. Since the addition of custom audio natively introduced to SA-MP, the ScriptPlayer project was disbanded, and converted into a raw data transmission plugin.
